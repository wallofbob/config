1. a) yes, since it contains Carbon and Hydrogen bonded together
	b) Carbon and Hydrogen

2. a) C4H10
	b) C8H18
3. length - long molecules at bottom(more heat) and short molecules on top(less heat)
	boiling point  - low boiling points at top and high boiling points at bottom
	ignition - easy at top and hard at bottom


5. 2C2H6 + 7O2 -> 4CO2 + 6H2O
	CH3CH2OH + O2 -> 2CO2 + 3H20
6  alkanes - single - saturated - alkenes - double - unsaturated 
7. i) the substance has the same formula but different structure
	ii) CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3
