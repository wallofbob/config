Documents for a meeting:
	1. Notice of a meeting
		-> people who are required to attend the meeting need to be informed about the meeting - date, time and place
		-> There is no agreed time prior to a meeting, vary from one enterprise to another
		-> The notice should not be less than a week, not more than 3 weeks - but this is usually, 		it can vary
	
	2. Agenda for the meeting
		-> the agenda should contain the following things:
			-> apologies for absence - required folks can't attend, say sorry
			-> minutes of the last meeting - notes, what each person said
			-> matters arising from the minutes - ask the attendees if they would like to discuss something that happened in the previous meetings
			-> any other business : the participants are allowed to discuss something important that's not on the agenda
			-> Date and time of the next meeting - allow participants to choose a time that's convenient for everyone. 

	3. Roles of the meeting
			-> The chairperson: this is the head of the meeting - they make sure that all the items of the agenda get covered, allocate the time, set the ground rules, and make sure everyone participates in the meeting. 
			-> Minute taker : this is the person who notes down a summary of the whole meeting, records who says what, what decisions have been reached, etc. Usually, there's no designated minute taker - this role rotates every meeting. However, it's possible for someone to do it every time. Again, this varies between businesses. Minutes are important because they: 
						-> give a true and accurate account of what happened
						-> are relatively brief, and give the main points of the meeting
						-> are clear, and can be referred to in the future, to see what was agreed upon - prevents fights, establishes the base for future meetings. 
						-> can provide information for those who were absent during the meeting
